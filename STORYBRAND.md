# Panorama StoryBrand Campaign

**Anchor:** *The View Is Better From Here*

---

## Character (Customer)
People who have earned a better view of life — and want a home that reflects it.
- Accomplished professionals, families, and empty nesters
- Some are moving up, some are starting fresh, some are downsizing without downgrading
- They value pride, stability, beauty, and belonging
- They want a home that feels like the next chapter, not a placeholder

## What They Want
A home where the view — and life — truly feels better.
- Panoramic views of the Wasatch Mountains
- A community that feels intentional, elevated, and thoughtfully designed
- A home that becomes the gathering place for family and friends
- Recreation, trails, and amenities right outside their door
- Proximity to schools, shopping, and neighbors they relate to

---

## Villain
**Settling for a life — and a home — without perspective.**
- Flat, crowded neighborhoods with no views
- Cookie-cutter homes that feel temporary or uninspired
- Communities where you have to leave just to enjoy life
- Living somewhere that doesn't reflect how far they've come

## External Problem
They can't find a community that delivers both the view and the lifestyle.
- Homes with views but no amenities or connection
- Great houses in forgettable neighborhoods
- Rentals or transitional housing that feel low-quality or disconnected
- Developments that promise more than they deliver

## Internal Problem
They want to feel proud — and inspired — when they come home.
- "I've worked too hard to settle for average."
- "I want my home to be the place everyone wants to gather."
- "I want a view that reminds me I made the right choices."

## Philosophical Problem
**It's just plain wrong to work this hard and still feel stuck with a lesser view.**
- A better life deserves a better setting
- Homes should lift your perspective — literally and figuratively
- Where you live should reflect who you've become

## Guide (Panorama)
**Panorama was designed so the view — and the lifestyle — are better from here.**
- Built into the foothills, making panoramic mountain views the norm, not the exception
- Elevated design standards ensure lasting beauty and pride
- State-of-the-art playgrounds, trails, dog park, and recreation create daily experiences
- A master-planned community where home is the destination

## The Plan
1. Choose a home or homesite with a view.
2. Move into a community designed around connection and recreation.
3. Enjoy a life where the view really is better from here.

## Call to Action
**Come see the view for yourself.**
- Direct CTA: "Schedule a tour at Panorama"
- Transitional CTA: "View available homesites" / "Explore the community map"

---

## Success
They wake up every day knowing they chose well.
- Panoramic views that never get old
- A home their family loves coming back to
- Recreation, connection, and beauty built into daily life
- Pride in where they live — and what it represents

## Failure
They settle — and always wonder what they missed.
- No views, no connection, no sense of reward
- A house that works, but doesn't inspire
- Regret that they didn't choose higher ground

## Character Transformation
**From:** Feeling stuck choosing between quality, location, and lifestyle
**To:** Confident, fulfilled, and proud — living somewhere the view is truly better
